                <p>
                    In the field of dermatology, the outstanding majority of cases are diagnosed by a visual examination as lesions are frequently external. Many specialists record cases by taking a picture of the affected region for their personal records, academic purposes, or to discuss a condition with fellow specialists. Dermalog is at the core, a private image storage application with the differential feature of a description file linked to a group of images.
